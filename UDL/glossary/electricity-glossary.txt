Atom: An <b>atom</b> is a very small piece of matter. Several atoms joined together are called molecules.

Attraction: <b>Attraction</b> is when two things pull toward each other

Attract: Two things <b>attract</b> when they pull toward each other.

Battery: A <b>battery<</b> creates voltage with a chemical reaction to run electrical devices.
 
Circuit: A <b>circuit</b> is a loop of conductive material that allows electric current to flow.

Capacitor: A <b>capacitor</b> is a device that can store charge.

Charged: <b>Charged</b> means having more of one type of charge than the other, so that the two types of charge are not equal. 

Collide: To <b>collide</b> is to run into or bump into.

Collision: A <b>collision</b> is when two think run into each other.
 
Charge: Electric <b>charge</b> is a basic property of the tiny particles that make up matter. Particles can have positive, negative, or no charge. 


Conductor: A <b>conductor</b> is a material that allows the free passage of charges, such as metals like iron, copper, and aluminum.

Current: <b>Electric current</b> is the flow of electric charges.

Circuit: An electric <b> circuit</b> is a continuous path that can carry an electric current.

Electricity: <b>Electricity</b> is a form of energy that is made up of positive and negative charges.

Electron: An <b>electron</b> is a tiny part of an element.  An electron has a negative charge.

Filament: A <b>filament</b> is the glowing wire inside a light bulb.

Generator: A <b>generator</b> is a device that converts mechanical energy to electrical energy.

Motor: A <b>motor</b> is a device that converts electrical energy to mechanical energy. 

Insulator: An <b>insulator</b> is a material that does not allow the passage of charges, such as wood, plastic, and air. 

Lightning: <b>Lightning</b> is the flow of charges through the air from cloud to cloud or from cloud to ground. 

Net charge: <b>Net charge</b> is the difference between positive and negative charges. If they are equal, the net charge is zero.

Neutral: <b>Neutral</b> means having no net electrical charge, because the number of positive and negative charges is equal.

Parallel circuit: A <b>parallel circuit</b> is an electric circuit with two or more paths that current can follow.

Polarity: <b>Polarity</b> is one end or the other of a battery or magnet.  For example, the positive or negative pole of a battery, or the north or sole pole of a magnet.

Positively charged: <b>Positively charged</b> means having more positive than negative charges, so that the net charge is positive.

Negatively charged: <b>Negatively charged</b> means having more negative than positive charges, so that the net charge is negative.

Proton: A <b>proton</b> is a basic particle with positive charge.

Repulsion: <b>Repulsion</b> is when two things push away from each other.

Resistance: <b>Resistance</b> is the measure of how much a material opposes the flow of electric current.

Series circuit: A <b>series circuit</b> is an electric circuit with only one path that current can follow.

Repel: Two things <b>repel</b> when they push away from each other.

Static: <b>Static electricity</b> is electric charges that aren't moving.

Voltage: <b>Voltage</b> is a measure of how much force is pushing charges through a circuit.
