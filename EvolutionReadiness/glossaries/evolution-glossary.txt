Acquired trait: An <b>acquired trait</b> is a feature gained by an organism during its lifetime that it doesn’t get from its parents. A scar is an acquired trait.  Adapt: To <b>adapt</b> is to change.  When a population adapts to a new environment, the inherited traits that improve the population's ability to survive and reproduce are passed on to new generations.Adapted: When a population evolves over many generations, it is becoming better <b>adapted</b> to the environment. Adaptation: <b>Adaptation</b> is the change over many generations of inherited traits that improves a population's ability to survive and reproduce.Ancestor: An <b>ancestor</b> is a parent, grandparent, and so on, going back through many generations.Annual: An <b>annual</b> plant completes its life cycle in one season.  Corn and marigolds are both examples of annuals. Mystery Plants are also annual plants.Breed: A <b>breed</b> is a group within a species with common features.  Beagles and German shepherds are breeds of dogs. 

Camouflage: <b>Camouflage</b> is a color or pattern on a plant or animal that helps it blend into its environment and hide from predators.

Carnivore: A <b>carnivore</b> is an animal that eats other animals.Common ancestor:  A <b>common ancestor</b> is an ancestor that is shared by different organisms. Cousins share a grandparent as a common ancestor.

Consumer: A <b>consumer</b> is an animal that eats (consumes) other living things for food.Data: <b>Data</b> are facts or information collected by scientists.  Scientists can graph number data to see the information in a different way.

Decomposer: A <b>decomposer</b> is an organism that feeds on and breaks down dead plant or animal matter. Mushrooms and earthworms are decomposers.

Decrease: To <b>decrease</b> is to go down in number.

Desert: A <b>desert</b> is a region where there is very little rainfall.Ecosystem: An <b>ecosystem</b> is a group of different kinds of organisms living in a particular environment.Environment: An <b>environment</b> is a place with certain features, such as type of soil, climate, amount of rainfall, or amount of sunshine.Evolution: <b>Evolution</b> is the process by which populations of organisms change their features over many generations. Evolve: When populations of organisms change their features over many generations, we say they have <b>evolved</b>. Extinct: <b>Extinct</b> means that a species has died out.  Dinosaurs are extinct because there are none living today.Extinction: <b>Extinction</b> is the complete disappearance of a species.Genes: <b>Genes</b> are the material that gives an organism all of its inherited characteristics. Generation: A <b>generation</b> is a group of organisms living at the same time.  Parents belong to one generation and children are in the next generation.

Herbivore: An <b>herbivore</b> is an animal that eats plants.

Hypothesis: A <b>hypothesis</b> is an idea that you can test.

Increase: To <b>increase</b> is to go up in number.Inherit: <b>Inherit</b> means to receive traits from parents. Children inherit eye color from their parents. Inherited trait: An <b>inherited trait</b> is a feature that is passed on to an organism from the parents. The leaf size of Mystery Plants is an inherited trait.Life cycle: <b>Life cycle</b> is the series of stages through which an organism grows – from a beginning stage in one individual to the same stage in its offspring. Litter: A <b>litter</b> is the set of babies born of the same parents at the same time. Mass extinction: <b>Mass extinction</b> is an event where very many different plants and animals go extinct around the same time.

Nonliving: Something is <b>nonliving</b> if it is not alive.Offspring: <b>Offspring</b> are the children of a parent.

Omnivore: An <b>omnivore</b> is an animal that eats both plants and other animals.Perennial: <b>Perennial</b> plants live for several years.  Apple trees and banana trees are both perennials. Population: A <b>population</b> is a group of organisms living in the same area that have babies with one another.Predator: A <b>predator</b> is an animal that lives by consuming (eating) other animals. Predators hunt for prey.

Producer: A <b>producer</b> is a living thing that makes its own food. Green plants are producers.

Protective coloration: <b>Protective coloration</b> describes a color or pattern on a plant or animal that helps it blend into its environment and hide from predators.

Prey: <b>Prey</b> is an animal that is hunted or caught for food by another animal. Prey are caught by predators.Reproduction: <b>Reproduction</b> is the process by which plants and animals produce offspring.Seedling: A <b>seedling</b> is a baby plant.Species: A <b>species</b> is a group of plants or animals that share features, live in the same environment, and can have babies together. Trait: A <b>trait</b> is a characteristic or feature of a plant or animal. Traits, like eye color, can be inherited from parents or acquired during a lifetime, like a scar.  Variation: <b>Variation</b> means the genetic differences from parents to children and between members of the same species. A child can be taller or shorter than his or her parents, and humans are all different heights.Variety: A <b>variety</b> is a group of plants within the same species with common features.  There are many different varieties of tomatoes.
