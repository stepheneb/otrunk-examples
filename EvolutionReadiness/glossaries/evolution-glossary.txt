Gas: A <b>gas</b> is a state in which matter has no definite shape or volume, for example, air.

Liquid: A <b>liquid</b> is a state in which matter has a definite volume but no definite shape, for example, drinking water.

Solid: <b>solid</b> is a state in which matter has a definite volume and shape, for example, earth. 

Water cycle: The <b>Water cycle</b> is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the earth. 

Matter: <b>Matter</b> is anything that takes up space. Solid, liquid and gas are all states of matter.
 
Water vapor: <b>Water vapor</b> is water in its state as a gas.
                        
Cloud: A <b>cloud</b> is water in the air in the form of tiny water droplets or ice crystals. 

Fog: <b>Fog</b> is a cloud near the ground.

Moist: <b>Moist</b> air is very humid.

Ice:  <b>Ice</b> is water in its state as a solid. Ice is a crystal.

Evaporation:  <b>Evaporation</b> is the process of changing from a liquid to a gas, for example, water changing from a liquid into water vapor. 

Evaporate: To <b>Evaporate</b> is to change from a liquid to a gas, for example, water changing from a liquid into water vapor. 

Condensation:  <b>Condensation</b> is the process of changing from a gas to a liquid, for example, water changing from water vapor into a liquid.

Condense:  To <b>Condense</b> is to change from a gas to a liquid, for example, water changing from water vapor into a liquid.

Condensed: To <b>Condense</b> is to change from a gas to a liquid, for example, water changing from water vapor into a liquid.

Atmosphere: The <b>Atmosphere</b> is the layer of air that surrounds the earth. It is made up of a mixture of gases, including nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor. 




Relative humidity: <b>Relative humidity</b> is a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air compared to the maximum the air can hold at that temperature.


Precipitation: <b>Precipitation</b> is any form of water that falls on the earth. It includes rain (water droplets), snow (ice crystals), sleet (frozen water droplets) and hail (big frozen water droplets). 



Melting: <b>Melting</b> is the process of changing from a solid to a liquid.

Freezing: <b>Freezing</b> is the process of changing from a liquid to a solid. 

Cloud cover: <b>Cloud cover</b> is the proportion of the sky that is filled in with clouds, usually expressed as a percent.
